&
an address-of operator, it returns the memory address of a variable

scanf("%lf", &radius);



%: 

this indicates the start of a format specifier

printf("Circumference: %lf\n", circumference);


* (int* nums)

Pointer declaration: When the asterisk appears before 
a variable name during declaration, it indicates a pointer variable. 
For example, in the line int* nums, nums is declared as a 
pointer to an integer. A pointer variable doesn't store the 
actual integer value itself, but instead, it stores 
the memory address where the integer value is located.



int main() {
    // Your code here

    return 0;  // Indicates successful completion
}
