How to create array in C:


1. Fixed-size array:
int numbers[8] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5};
This declares an array numbers with a fixed size of 8

2.Initializer list (C99 onwards):
int numbers[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5};
Size of the array based on the number of elements provided in the initializer




sizeof()
is a built-in operator in C that returns the size of a variable or expression in bytes.


int numsSize = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);
sizeof(nums) gives you the total size of the nums array in bytes.
nums[0] refers to the first element.
sizeof(nums[0]) calculates the size of a single element in the array, 
which is the size of an integer in this case (assuming nums is an integer array).
